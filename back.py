        Hereâ€™s the question for your assessment:
        - Question: '{response.question_text}'
        - Student's Response: '{response.student_response}'

        Your Task:
        - Rate the response on a scale of 1 to 10 for signs of depression:
          - 1-2: No signs of depression.
          - 3-4: Mild signs of depression.
          - 5-6: Moderate signs of depression.
          - 7-8: Noticeable signs of depression.
          - 9-10: Significant signs of depression.

        If you are unsure or the response is unclear, still provide a depression score in the range of 1 to 10. If the response is not related to depression, assign a neutral score of 5. 

        Your response should be in the following JSON format:
        {{
          "depression_score": <number between 1 and 10>, 
          "notes": "<any notes or explanation you may have>"
        }}

        Please ensure the response contains both a "depression_score" and "notes" key, even if the assessment is uncertain.
